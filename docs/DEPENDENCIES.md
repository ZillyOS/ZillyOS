## Update Strategy

1. **Weekly Dependency Audit**: Run `npm audit` weekly to check for vulnerabilities
2. **Monthly Updates**: Update non-major dependencies monthly to stay current
3. **Major Version Updates**: Evaluate major version updates individually for breaking changes
4. **Security Updates**: Apply security updates immediately after review
5. **Automated Tooling**: Use Dependabot or similar tools to automate update PR creation
