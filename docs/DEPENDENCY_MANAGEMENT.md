# ZillyOS Dependency Management Strategy

This document outlines the strategy for managing dependencies in the ZillyOS project, including update frequency, security audits, and governance.

## Update Frequency

ZillyOS follows a structured approach to dependency updates:

### Regular Updates

| Type | Frequency | Notes |
|------|-----------|-------|
| Security Updates | Immediate | Security patches are applied as soon as they are available |
| Patch Updates | Weekly | Non-breaking bug fixes and minor improvements |
| Minor Updates | Monthly | New features that maintain backward compatibility |
| Major Updates | Quarterly | Breaking changes, require careful review and testing |

### Automated Updates

We use GitHub Dependabot to automate dependency updates:

1. Dependabot is configured to scan dependencies daily
2. Security patches are given highest priority
3. Update PRs are created automatically for review
4. CI must pass before approval
5. Major version updates require additional manual testing

## Security Audit Process

Security is a top priority for dependency management:

### Regular Audits

1. **Automated Daily Scan**: `npm audit` runs daily in CI pipeline
2. **Weekly Manual Review**: Team reviews the output of `npm audit` weekly
3. **Vulnerability Triage**: Vulnerabilities are assessed for:
   - Severity
   - Exploitability in our context
   - Potential workarounds
   - Timeline for fixes

### New Dependency Review

Before adding a new dependency, it must pass a security review:

1. **Necessity Assessment**: Is this dependency truly needed?
2. **Security History**: Review the package's security history
3. **Maintenance Status**: Is the package actively maintained?
4. **License Compliance**: Verify license compatibility
5. **Size and Impact**: Evaluate bundle size impact
6. **Alternatives**: Consider alternatives with better security profiles

## Dependency Governance

### Approval Workflow

New dependencies or major version updates require approval:

1. **Request**: Developer submits dependency request with justification
2. **Review**: Technical lead reviews request and security implications
3. **Approval**: Project maintainer gives final approval
4. **Integration**: Dependency is added with appropriate version constraints
5. **Documentation**: Update dependency documentation

### Dependency Guidelines

1. **Minimize Dependencies**: Only add dependencies when necessary
2. **Prefer Established Packages**: Choose well-maintained, widely-used packages
3. **Version Pinning**: Pin versions to avoid unexpected updates
4. **Monorepo Consistency**: Maintain consistent versions across monorepo
5. **Regular Pruning**: Remove unused dependencies

## Monitoring and Reporting

### Dependency Health Metrics

1. **Outdated Report**: Weekly report of outdated dependencies
2. **Security Vulnerabilities**: Count and severity of known vulnerabilities
3. **Bundle Size Impact**: Track the impact of dependencies on bundle size
4. **Dependency Depth**: Monitor the depth of the dependency tree

### Reporting Workflow

1. Generate dependency health report weekly
2. Distribute report to development team
3. Schedule regular dependency review meetings
4. Track metrics over time to identify trends

## Emergency Updates

In case of critical vulnerabilities:

1. **Alert**: Security team alerts development team
2. **Assessment**: Immediate assessment of vulnerability impact
3. **Mitigation**: Apply temporary mitigation if needed
4. **Update**: Fast-track the dependency update process
5. **Verification**: Verify the fix resolves the vulnerability
6. **Post-Mortem**: Review how the vulnerability affects the project

## Tools and Resources

- **npm audit**: Primary tool for vulnerability scanning
- **Dependabot**: Automated dependency updates
- **Bundle analyzer**: Analyze dependency impact on bundle size
- **Snyk**: Additional security scanning
- **OWASP Dependency-Check**: Verify against known vulnerability databases
